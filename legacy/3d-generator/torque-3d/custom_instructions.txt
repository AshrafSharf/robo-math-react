See the torque.png and draw the angle and perpedicular component in torque lessons.

1. Identify the **reference point** (about which torque is calculated).
2. Do not assume it’s the origin unless stated.
3. A force acts along a **line of action**, not at a single point.
4. You may slide the force arrow anywhere along that line.
5. By convention, draw its **tail** at a chosen point on the line.
6. Keep the arrow pointing in the given direction (never flip).
7. The **position vector $\vec{r}$** starts at the reference point.
8. It ends at a point on the force’s line of action.
9. That point is often chosen for convenience (e.g. origin).
10. So $\vec{r} = \overrightarrow{AP}$ if torque is about $A$.
11. Torque is defined as $\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$.
12. Its magnitude = $|\vec{r}|\,|\vec{F}| \sin\theta$.
13. Its direction is **perpendicular** to the plane of $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$.
14. Use the **right-hand rule**: curl fingers r→F, thumb = torque.
15. In diagrams, show torque as a normal at the reference point.
16. Color-code: $\vec{r}$ (purple), $\vec{F}$ (green), $\vec{\tau}$ (red).
17. In Three.js, use `ArrowHelper` with start point = correct anchor.
18. Scale arrows for visibility; don’t let magnitude distort clarity.
19. Add a plane helper to show the r–F plane if teaching.
20. Remember: physics meaning (about point A) always comes before graphics convenience (origin).
